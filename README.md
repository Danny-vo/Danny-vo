- Hi, I’m @Danny
- I’m currently doing my Master degree in Actuarial Studies at Macquarie University and I will finish my study at the end of 2025.
- Through prior internships, I've got an opportunity to enhance my Excel skills as I used it daily for my work. Through Macquarie University, I have learned how to use R (ggplot, dplyr) and use Python (numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn,...)
-  My biggest passion is to use my statistical knowledge and technical skills to solve practical, business problems.
-  If you have any questions or enquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me via khuongduy3103@gmail.com
