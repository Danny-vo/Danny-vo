- Hi, I’m @Danny
- I’m currently doing my Master degree in Actuarial Studies at Macquarie University and I will finish my study at the end of 2025.
- Through prior internship, I got an opportunity to enhance my Excel skills as I used it daily. Through university, I have learned how to use R (ggplot, dplyr) and use Python (numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn)
-  My biggest passion is to use my statistical knowledge and technical skills to solve practical, business problems.
-  What I enjoy the most is to collaborate with people from different backgrounds to know their perspective on the problem and also explain the technical thingy to people.
-  If you have any questions or enquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me via khuongduy3103@gmail.com
